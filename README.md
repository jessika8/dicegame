# Two people dice game

Dice game is a JavaScript DOM project that allows fun loving people to play a game that takes turns. It is my first project where I combine my knowlege of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to start the game?

- Pull the game
- Open the game with Live Server

## Future plans with the game

- A choice to add more players
- Statistical scoring (how many times a player has palyed and won)
