# Two people dice game

The dice game is a JavaScript DOM project that allows fun-loving people to play a game that takes turns. It is my first project where I combine my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to start the game?

- Pull the game
- Open the game with Live Server
- It opens on the http://localhost:3000/

## How can I make the project better?

- A choice to add more players
- Statistical scoring (how many times a player has played and won)
